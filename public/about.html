<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> The decision to study Art and Design at
  higher levels is one which I have spent a
  lot of time thinking about. After
  conference with friends and tutors I
  have decided that this is the right
  decision for me as although I am
  performing better academically in
  another subject, it is in art and design
  that my real passion lies.
